## Shuffle

**Type**: Obfuscation

**Description**: I put the flag in [ascii art](ASCII_Art.txt), I then inserted the line number into a random place in each line in this format '::123::' and then shuffled the lines.

**Format**: plain text with spaces.

Unshuffle the ASCII art to work out the flag.
