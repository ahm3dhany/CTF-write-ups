### The Problem:

  > One of our cyber monkeys got a cipher text from his in-laws and cannot read it. 
  > Can you crack this ciphertext "dzluin hzuwna bok gwn qibt zd wzkknoqibt"?

### The Solution:

1. Go to http://www.dcode.fr/affine-cipher
2. put "dzluin hzuwna bok gwn qibt zd wzkknoqibt"
   in the input field titled "AFFINE CIPHERTEXT"
   choose "TRY ALL COEFFICIENTS (BRUTEFORCE DECRYPTION ATTACK)"
   click "DECRYPT"
3. One of the results is "SIMPLECIPHERANDTHEFLAGISHIDDENFLAG"
   
   Convert it to "simple cipher and the flag is hiddenflag" to be inlined with:

		 "dzluin hzuwna bok gwn qibt zd wzkknoqibt"

### The flag:
`simple cipher and the flag is hiddenflag`
